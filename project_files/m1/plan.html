<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Concisely state what the goal (purpose) of the website is. Note that the mission must be to improve<br>
  something in a measurable way. Why is the site needed? How does it benefit the client? Be clear and<br>
  specific. Good mission statements are usually only a few sentences and contain no unnecessary<br>
information.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Describe the process(es) by which the site's success will be evaluated. How do you know that the site<br>
does what the client wanted? Measure the mission you stated above.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Describe two things clearly and specifically:<br>
  1. the target audience that your site is intended for (be specific; you can't aim for everyone)<br>
  2. how you will intentionally design the site to cater to this group (as distinct from another,<br>
different target audience).</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>This section should contain a dot-point list of the pages you intend to make and the content to go on<br>
each of those pages. Use a table or nested list or something clear. Create the flowchart from this.</p>
<h2>Site Flowchart (Structure Diagram)</h2>
<p>Create a site flowchart to show the hierarchy of pages in the site and their relationships.<br>
  Each page should be represented by one box. The order of boxes is the order these links should<br>
  appear on the site.<br>
  If you don't have a preferred drawing program for flowcharts, use www.draw.io.<br>
  Save your flowchart as a PNG file (normally the best file format for plain, straight-lined diagrams like<br>
this) and insert the image in your plan file under this heading.</p>
